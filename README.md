# Guides for devs to learn F# real FAST

Choose the language you're currently most proficient in:

1. [C#](csharp2fsharp.md)
2. [Python](python2fsharp.md)

If you want to contribute your language guide, fork and propose PR!

After (or before?) you have finished reading one (or both?) of the guides above, you might find it interesting to watch this short 20-min talk: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/ideology

And in case you are already an F# guru and you're still hungry for more knowledge, I think Rust is also a very nice langauge, so here you have links to other side-by-side sample guides for learning Rust for F# 
developers:
* [F# is the .NET Rust - @jkone27](https://jkone27-3876.medium.com/f-is-the-net-rust-62f71f8dae41)
* [Rust for Fsharpers and F# for Rustaceans - Dave MacLeod aka @Dhghomon](https://github.com/Dhghomon/rust-fsharp)
